# SMART-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM
Built a Smart Health Monitoring System using LPC1768 (ARM Cortex-M3) to monitor temperature, heart rate, and SpO₂ with real-time data processing. Implemented threshold-based alerts and UART/GSM communication for reliable, low-power remote patient monitoring in medical and home-care applications.
