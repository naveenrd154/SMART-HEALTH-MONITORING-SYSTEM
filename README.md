# SMART HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM

## Overview
The Smart Health Monitoring System is an embedded healthcare solution designed to continuously monitor vital health parameters and enable remote patient supervision. The system is built using the LPC1768 (ARM Cortex-M3) microcontroller and biomedical sensors, making it suitable for medical and home-care environments.

## Description
Built a Smart Health Monitoring System using LPC1768 (ARM Cortex-M3) to monitor temperature, heart rate, and SpO₂ in real time. The system processes sensor data continuously and triggers alerts when predefined threshold values are exceeded. UART and GSM communication are used to transmit health data and alerts for remote monitoring, ensuring reliable and low-power operation.
